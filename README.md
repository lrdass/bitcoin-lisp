# BitcoinLisp

BitcoinLisp is a Bitcoin Core implementation written in Lisp. It aims to provide a fast, efficient, and reliable implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, with the added benefits of Lisp's expressiveness and flexibility.

## Getting Started

To use BitcoinLisp, you will need to have a working installation of Lisp on your machine. Currently, BitcoinLisp has been tested and is known to work on SBCL, but it should be compatible with other Common Lisp implementations as well.

Once you have Lisp installed, you can simply clone this repository and run `bitcoinlisp.lisp` to start the BitcoinLisp node.

## Features

- Full implementation of the Bitcoin protocol
- Support for mining, transactions, and *maybe* wallets
- Built-in support for JSON-RPC API
- Fast and efficient block processing
- Easy-to-use interface with Lisp REPL

## Contributing

## Final Quote

"In a world of complex and rigid systems, Lisp provides the flexibility and expressiveness needed to build innovative and efficient solutions. With BitcoinLisp, we bring the power of Lisp to the world of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, creating a new paradigm for decentralized systems." - Anonymous Lisp Programmer
